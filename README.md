# DWMBlocks Network Status Script

A **network status module** for [dwmblocks](https://github.com/torrinfail/dwmblocks) built using **Bash** and **NetworkManager**.  
It displays your current network state (Ethernet/WiFi/VPN) directly in the dwm status bar with useful icons.

## ‚ú® Features
- Detects whether **NetworkManager** is running.
- Shows:
  - **Disconnected** status if no network is active.
  - **Ethernet** connection with (masked) IP address.
  - **WiFi** connection with SSID and signal strength.
  - **VPN** active indicator (optional).
- Uses **nerd-font icons** for a clean and modern look.
- Masked IP for privacy when sharing screenshots or configs online.
